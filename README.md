# Height Prediction using Linear Regression 📏🤖

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict a person’s **height** based on their **weight** using a simple height–weight dataset.

## 📌 Overview
- **Input Feature:** Weight
- **Target Variable:** Height
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
- `Weight` – Weight of the person
- `Height` – Height of the person

The data is used to learn a linear relationship between weight and height.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Make height predictions
6. Evaluate model performance

## 📈 Visualization
A scatter plot is used to show the correlation between weight and height, along with the regression line for better understanding.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
